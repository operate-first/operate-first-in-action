## What is Operate First? 

While open source has made software widely available, it has also exposed another barrier to entry: the ability to operate software in production. Proprietary services for operations undermine the open source model, so we must now shift our focus to open sourcing operations.

In doing so, developers and operators collaborate to apply a projectâ€™s operational considerations right back into the code. The result?

**Better code, better performance, better final product.**

## AI at the Edge Demo

Check out the full demo [HERE!](https://github.com/AICoE/summit-2022-octo-keynote#summit-2021-octo-keynote)  

In this demo we will walk you through how to manage a machine learning application lifecycle on an edge device using a couple of projects developed by Red Hat's Emerging Technologies group. Specifically, Open Data Hub, Microshift and Meteor running on the Operate First Community cloud.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the development, training and deployment of a real intelligent edge device, an autonomous RV car, via the [Operate First community cloud](https://www.operate-first.cloud/).
